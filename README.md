## Project overview

**trailer-evaluation-website** is a full-stack web project.

I built it using the technologies I learned during secondary education:
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** PHP
- **Database:** MySQL

### Main flow
From the main page (`index1.html`), you can view trailers for **three movies**.  
To watch a trailer, simply click on the movie poster image. The selected trailer plays in the video player.
